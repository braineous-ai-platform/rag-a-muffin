# Causal Reasoning Engine — Day Wrap-Up (2025-10-14)

## 🧠 Concept

The **Causal Graph Orchestrator (CGO)** evolved today from design to an executable reasoning path.

The principle:

> Facts are nodes.  
> Rules are edges.  
> Reasoning is traversal.

Unlike a transformer’s attention that statistically distributes focus, the CGO deterministically computes _why_ one fact leads to another — an explicit causal chain instead of latent correlation.

## ⚙️ Code & Integration

- **`meme.json`** — defines a micro-reasoning test using human-style context.
- **`ReasoningIntegrationTests.java`** — integration test validating runtime loading of facts/rules and end-to-end traversal.
- **`weaviate_embeddings.json`** — acts as the embedding layer prototype that feeds nodes into the reasoning graph.
- **Next iteration:** unify both — embeddings → fact normalization → causal traversal → prompt synthesis.

## 🧩 Next Thought

Tomorrow’s focus → formalize **causal_graph_injection**: a lightweight module to inject causal context into any app/service (FastAPI, SpringBoot, etc.).  
Essentially: _dependency injection for reasoning._

The goal → turn “explainable inference” into a reusable, composable primitive.
